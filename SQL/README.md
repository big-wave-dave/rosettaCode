These are the Rosetta Code's descriptions of the tasks.

===================
===[Create a file](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Create_a_file#SQLite)===
===================
"The Task:
In this task, the job is to create a new empty file called "output.txt" of size 0 bytes and an empty directory called "docs". This should be done twice: once "here", i.e. in the current working directory and once in the filesystem root."

===================
===[Table creation/Postal addresses](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Table_creation/Postal_addresses#SQLite)===
===================
"The Task:
In this task, the goal is to create a table to store addresses. You may assume that all the addresses to be stored will be located in the USA. As such, you will need (in addition to a field holding a unique identifier) a field holding the street address, a field holding the city, a field holding the state code, and a field holding the zipcode. Choose appropriate types for each field.

For non-database languages, show how you would open a connection to a database (your choice of which) and create an address table in it. You should follow the existing models here for how you would structure the table."
